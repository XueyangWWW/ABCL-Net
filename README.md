# Introduction
The ABCL-Net, designed for multi-task cooperation and cross-modality feature interchange, excels at performing both missing modality generation and tissue segmentation simultaneously. By inputting one T1w (T2w) image, users can obtain one generated T2w (T1w) image and one predicted label for macaque brain tissue segmentation.
